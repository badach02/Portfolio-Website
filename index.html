          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>My name is Daniel Badach. I'm currently a student at Pennsylvania State University Erie Campus, getting my bachelors in Software Engineering, where I expect to graduate in spring of 2027. I was born and raised in Erie, Pennsylvania, and I'm 22 years old.</p>
          <p>Software and programming has always been an interest to me ever since I was young. As a kid, I would watch my brother player many different video games. Of course, every young kids dream is to make their own game and see people playing it. Eventually I would find myself on ROBLOX developing small projects, cultivating my interest in Software Engineering at the young ages of 10-13.</p>
          <p>As I grew older and found myself branching out and seeing different kinds of software, I grew out of the "Game Development" stage and found myself doing whatever hobbyist projects or things for my friends. This site exists as an about me and a place to showcase my resume and some GitHub projects.</p>
